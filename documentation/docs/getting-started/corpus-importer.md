!!! info "Prerequisites"  
    This section requires that you have already set up the PostgreSQL DB and, preferably, the Web Portal. If not, refer to the respective [documentation](./webportal.md).

The **Corpus-Importer** is a Java application that transforms and imports UIMA-annotated data from a local path into the UCE environment. Depending on the configuration, it also performs post-processing of the data, such as the creation of embedding spaces.

!!! tip "UIMA"  
    If the data is not yet available in UIMA format, refer to the respective [documentation](./uima-duui.md), which also utilizes the [Docker Unified UIMA Interface](./uima-duui.md) to transform, process, and **annotate** the data in UIMA format the best way possible. After having transformed your data, proceed here.

## Folder Structure

Having set up the database and the web portal *(locally or via docker)*, all that is left to do is to tell the importer where to import from and start it.

For this, the importer **always** requires the following folder structure:

``` title="Required Folder Structure"
üìÅ corpus_a
‚îÇ   üìÑ corpusConfig.json
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄüìÅ input
    ‚îÇ   üìÑ uima_doc_1.xmi
    ‚îÇ   üìÑ uima_doc_2.xmi
    ‚îÇ   üìÑ ...
    ‚îÇ   üìÑ uima_doc_n.xmi
```

where [`corpusConfig.json`](./configuration.md) holds metadata, and the `input` folder contains the actual UIMA files for a single corpus.

!!! note "Input Structure"
     As of now, the importer will recursively walk through the `input` folder, so every `.xmi` file in any subfolder will be considered.

## User Setup

Open the `docker-compose.yaml` file *(if you haven't created the `.env` file yet, see [here](./webportal.md))* and locate the `uce-importer` service. Within it, mount all local paths to the corpora you want to import using the structure described above, and map them like so: 

```yaml
volumes:
    - "./path/to/my_corpora/corpus_a:/app/input/corpora/corpus_a"
    - "./path/to/other_corpora/corpus_b:/app/input/corpora/corpus_b"
    - "..."
```

*You can mount as many corpora as you like using the same structure. Remember that you can adjust the amount of threads used through the `.env` file.*

Afterwards, simply start the importer through the compose:

```
docker-compose up --build uce-importer
```

The importer will automatically import all corpora that is mounted to its local `/app/input/corpora/` volume.

## Developer Setup

In the source code, identify the module `uce.corpus-importer` and set up your IDE:

!!! note "Setup"
    - Add a new `Application` configuration  
    - UCE is developed in **Java 21**  
    - Set `-cp corpus-importer`  
    - Main class: `org.texttechnologylab.App`  
    - CLI arguments are obligatory:
        * `-src "./path/to/your_corpus/"`
        * `-num 1`
        * `-t 1`
    - Maven should automatically download and index the dependencies. If, for some reason, it does not, you can force an update via `mvn clean install -U` *(in IntelliJ, open `Execute Maven Goal`, then enter the command)*.

Open the `common.conf` file and adjust the database connection parameters to match your database (port, host, etc.). Now start the importer and import your corpus. Refer to [CLI Arguments](#cli-arguments) for a full list of possible parameters.

!!! info "Logs"
    The importer logs to both the PostgreSQL database *(tables `uceimport` and `importlog`)* and the local `logs` directory within the container. Both logs also appear in the standard output of the console.

## CLI Arguments

| <div style="width:130px">Argument</div> | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `-src` <br/> `--importSrc` | The path to the corpus source where the UIMA-annotated files are stored. |
| `-srcDir` <br/> `--importDir` | Unlike `-src`, `-srcDir` is the path to a directory that holds multiple importable `src` paths. The importer will check for folders within this directory, where each folder should be an importable corpus with a corpusConfig.json and its input UIMA-files. Those are then imported. |
| `-num` <br/> `--importerNumber` | When starting multiple importers, assign an id to each instance by counting up from 1 to n **(not relevant as off now, just set it to 1)**. |
| `-t` <br/> `--numThreads` | UCE imports asynchronous. Decide with how many threads, e.g. 4-8-16. By default, this is single threaded. |
| `-view` <br/> `--casView` | Name of the CAS view to import from. If not set, the default view (initial view) is used. Adjust this only if you're familiar with CAS views and UIMA. Otherwise, you probably don't need this. |
