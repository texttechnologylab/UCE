UCE is applied across a variety of projects, some of which are outlined in this section, as they are open-source and/or publicly available, while some are not.

Depending on the domain and subject matter - ranging from biology to legal contexts - the NLP pipeline, and consequently the UCE portal, are dynamically adapted.

If you would like to propose a new project using UCE and/or our NLP tools, feel free to [contact us](https://www.texttechnologylab.org/appointments/)!
